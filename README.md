GBA4iOS (with iCade Support | forked)
===========

![GBA4iOS](http://gba4iosapp.com/images/download/gba4ios2_devices.png)

This is a fork of the famous Game Boy Advance emulator for iOS.

Since the original developer @rileytestut does not maintain the project at the moment, I forked the project and manually fixed some bugs and features from the pull-requests (!).

I'm not an Objective-C programmer, I have just copy'n'pasted things together.

Credit goes out to the other folks. (pull-requests sources at the bottom)

Getting Started
================

GBA4iOS can be opened in Xcode and deployed to an iOS device just like an other app, but there are a few steps that need to be completed first:

- Download and install [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/)  
- From the root directory, run the following command in terminal:
`pod install`  
- Open up the .xcworkspace file, and deploy to your device!
- (Ignore the 150 errors for using deprecated functions 😰)

Requirements
=============

- GBA4iOS 2.0 requires Xcode 5 or later, targeting iOS 7.0 and above.  
- For deployment to iOS 6 devices, use the project in the 1.x branch.
